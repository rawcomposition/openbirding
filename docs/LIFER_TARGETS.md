# Lifer Targets & Hot Zones

A tool that takes a birder's eBird life list and finds the places — individual
hotspots or geographic zones — where they can see the most species they haven't
recorded yet ("lifers"), filtered by how frequently each species is reported and
how well-sampled the location is.

No other birding app does this at global scale. It responds in tens of
milliseconds.

- **Bird Finder** (existing): pick one species → where is it?
- **Lifer Targets** (new): upload your whole life list → where should I go?

---

## What it does

1. Upload an eBird life-list CSV (parsed entirely in the browser — never stored
   server-side).
2. Pick a **minimum frequency** (how likely a species is at a place) and a
   **minimum number of checklists** (to ignore under-sampled "nonsense"
   locations), optionally scoped to an eBird **region**.
3. Get a ranked, mapped list of either:
   - **Hotspots** — individual eBird hotspots, or
   - **Zones** — ~36 km² H3 hexagons ("if I bird this whole area…"), better for
     trip planning. Zones are named after the most-birded hotspot inside them
     ("Amazon Manú Lodge area") and render as real hexagons on the map (as
     graduated circles when zoomed out, crossfading to hexes around z8).
4. Select any result to see the exact potential lifers, most-likely first
   (each links to its eBird species page). Selected zones also list the best
   hotspots inside them (a bbox query over the hotspot index), bridging
   "this area is rich" to "go to this exact spot".

The list and map are two views of one selection: hovering a row highlights its
feature, clicking a row flies the map to it, clicking a feature scrolls its row
into view, and clicking empty map clears the selection. Filter changes keep the
previous results on screen (dimmed) instead of flashing to skeletons.

## How it works (architecture)

### The core insight

The number of lifers at a location is:

```
lifers[loc] = qCount[loc] − seenCount[loc]
```

- `qCount[loc]` = number of species at `loc` above the frequency threshold
  (**user-independent** → precomputable).
- `seenCount[loc]` = how many of those the user has already seen
  (**user-specific**, but only touches the user's ~few-hundred–few-thousand
  species).

This flips a brutal 36M-row `GROUP BY` (≈4–9 s worldwide) into two small indexed
scans. We precompute `qCount` per location at a fixed set of frequency
thresholds; at query time we only walk the user's seen species.

### The companion database: `lifers.db`

Built from the 12 GB read-only `targets.db` by
`api/scripts/build-lifers-db.ts`. It is **never** modified in place — the source
is attached read-only and a fresh `lifers.db` (~760 MB) is written. Tables:

| Table          | Rows   | Purpose |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| `species`      | 11 k   | id ↔ code / common / scientific name for resolution |
| `loc_meta`     | 293 k  | hotspot metadata + total checklists, keyed by dense `loc_ref` |
| `loc_species`  | 20 M   | `(species_id, loc_ref, bucket_level)` — species→location index |
| `loc_qcount`   | 2 M    | precomputed `qCount` per (bucket, location) |
| `zone_meta`    | 305 k  | H3 cell metadata + total checklists |
| `zone_species` | 28 M   | `(species_id, cell_ref, bucket_level)` for zones |
| `zone_qcount`  | 2 M    | precomputed `qCount` per (bucket, cell) |

`bucket_level` is the frequency threshold quantized to an integer 0–6, so the
in-memory index needs no float math.

### The in-memory index

At API startup (`api/lib/lifers-index.ts`) the whole thing is loaded into
compact typed arrays:

- Per-location metadata arrays (samples, lat/lng, region code).
- `qCount[bucket]` as `Int32Array`s.
- A **compressed-sparse-row (CSR)** species→location index (`spOff`, `csrRef`,
  `csrLvl`) — ~100 MB for hotspots, ~140 MB for zones.

A query (`api/lib/geo-query.ts`) then:

1. Walks only the user's seen species through the CSR, incrementing a `counter`
   per location.
2. Scans locations once, computing `qCount − counter`, keeping the top-K in a
   bounded min-heap.

**Hotspots load eagerly (~17 s at boot); zones load lazily in the background**
so nothing blocks startup and users never wait.

### Frequency thresholds are bucketed

Users choose from presets **1% / 3% / 5% / 10% / 20% / 30% / 50%** (fraction of
checklists). These are the buckets baked into `lifers.db`. `minChecklists` is
fully dynamic (a per-location filter), not bucketed.

## Performance

Measured on the full worldwide dataset with a 388-species life list:

| Query                         | Time |
|-------------------------------|------|
| Worldwide hotspots, 5%, ck≥50 | ~50 ms |
| Worldwide hotspots, 1%, ck≥20 | ~25 ms |
| Region-filtered (US-CA)       | ~30 ms |
| Worldwide zones, 5%, ck≥50    | ~40 ms |
| Hotspot / zone species detail | ~5 ms |

Compared to the naive SQL approach (4–9 s), this is a 100–400× speedup. Build
time for `lifers.db` is ~3.5 minutes.

Memory: hotspots ~100 MB + zones ~140 MB resident, comfortably within the
24 GB VPS.

## API

All under `/api/v1/lifers`. Species are matched by code → scientific name →
common name → base-binomial fallback.

- `GET  /status` — index readiness, buckets, version, `zonesLoaded`.
- `POST /hotspots` — `{ species: [{sciName, commonName, code}], frequency,
  minChecklists, region?, bbox?, limit? }` → ranked hotspots.
- `POST /hotspot/:locationId` — the specific lifer species at one hotspot.
- `POST /zones` — same body → ranked H3 zones.
- `POST /zone/:cellRef` — the specific lifer species in one zone.

Items carry a human-readable `regionName` (resolved from the `regions` table,
walking up the code hierarchy for unknown sub-codes) and zones carry an
`anchorHotspot` — the most-birded hotspot within 4 km of the cell center, found
via a 0.5° spatial grid built over the hotspot index at load.

`frequency` accepts a fraction (`0.05`) or a percent (`5`); it snaps to the
nearest bucket.

## Notable findings / decisions

- **`samples` is per-location, constant across species** in `year_obs` — it is
  the total checklist count at that location, which is exactly the "min
  checklists" filter the user wanted.
- **Hotspots use adjusted frequency (`score`)**; **zones use raw frequency**
  (`obs/samples`) because the H3 tables only carry raw observation counts. Worth
  unifying if it ever matters, but both are reasonable "how likely" signals.
- **SQLite `HAVING` alias-collision bug (fixed):** `SELECT SUM(samples) AS
  samples ... HAVING samples >= 10` binds `samples` to the raw *column*, not the
  aggregate alias. This silently dropped ~⅔ of valid zones (97 k vs 305 k) until
  the aggregate was aliased to a distinct name. The location table happened to
  be immune because `samples` is constant per group there.
- **Results validate against intuition:** for a mostly-California life list, the
  top targets are Amazonian and Andean lodges (Rio Cristalino, Manu, Los
  Amigos), which is exactly right.

## Follow-ups / ideas

- ~~**Region names for zones.**~~ Done — resolved from the `regions` table,
  plus hotspot-anchored zone names.
- ~~**Render zones as hexagons.**~~ Done — `h3-js` boundaries with an
  antimeridian unwrap, circle fallback below ~z8 where hexes are sub-pixel.
- **Month filter.** The month-partitioned data exists (`h3_cell_*`, `month_obs`)
  — a "planning a trip in October" filter is very doable but would need
  per-month buckets (bigger `lifers.db`) or an on-the-fly path.
- **"Trip" aggregation.** Combine several nearby zones into a route and show the
  combined lifer total.
- **Rebuild cadence.** `lifers.db` must be rebuilt whenever `targets.db` is
  refreshed. Wire `npx tsx api/scripts/build-lifers-db.ts` into the same
  pipeline that regenerates `targets.db`, then hot-swap (mirror the existing
  `swapTargetsDb` retire-on-idle pattern if zero-downtime swap is needed).
- **Very large life lists** (10k+ species) persist to `localStorage`; if it
  exceeds quota the tool still works for the session but won't remember the list.
  Consider IndexedDB if this becomes common.

## Deploying

1. Build the companion DB next to `targets.db`:
   `cd api && npx tsx scripts/build-lifers-db.ts`
   (honors `TARGETS_DB` / `LIFERS_DB` env overrides; defaults to the web root).
2. Ensure `lifers.db` sits in `SQLITE_DIR` (same dir as `targets.db`).
3. Start the API — the index warms automatically. `GET /api/v1/lifers/status`
   reports readiness.
